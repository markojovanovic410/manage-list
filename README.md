# Simple-Heroku-Mern-App
This is a simple MERN app created using MERN(MongoDb, ExpressJs, React and NodeJs), axios.
In local environment, local MongoDB is used,  
but after deployed on the Heroku, the cluster supported by cloud.mongodb.com is used as DB.

This app is my simple coding test app using MERN, and it's a contact app: it's needed to create contacts and 
store them in a database, then to fetch contacts and show them.
Here we can insert, modify or delete a contact, accordingly every modification will be stored in the database 
in realtime.
